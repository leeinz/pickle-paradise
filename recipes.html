    <h1>Some notes before we begin...</h1>
    <ul>
  <li>Typically, veggies with a tougher skin like cucumbers and peppers do best in the pickling process, but root vegetables like carrots and radishes also work well. A good rule of thumb is the sturdier the vegetable, the better.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Another good rule of thumb is to use fresh produce. Last summer, I made my pickles using organic, locally grown produce from New York State farms. Fresh vegetables, fruits, and herbs boost flavor and nutritional value. (Asking a friend for a portion of their garden's bounty in return for some delicious pickles isn't a bad idea, either!)</li>
  <br>
  <li>Finally, get creative! Pickling is a great opportunity to play with a variety of flavor profiles. Always taste your spice mixture and pickling liquid before canning, and remember that flavors continue to age and marinate after the jars are sealed.</li>
  <br>
   <li>Pickles take time! This pickle recipe takes a short time to assemble, but takes 1-4 weeks to mature depending upon how sour you like your pickles.</li>

    <h2>You will need:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Sterilized mason jars, lids, and bands</li>
        <li>3-4 lbs of kirby/pickling cucumbers</li>
        <li>Kosher Salt</li>
        <li>2 Liters of Water</li>
        <li>As much garlic as you'd like (I typically use about a head or two)</li>
        <li>Grape leaves or "pickle crisp"</li>
        <li>Whole Peppercorns</li>
        <li>Fresh Dill</li>
        <li>Whatever additional spices you'd like</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Place cucumbers in ice bath for 15-60 minutes.</li>
        <li>Scrub well and remove the blossom end.</li>
        <li>Stir six tablespoons into water until dissolved.</li>
        <li>Add your garlic, peppercorns, dill, and other spices.</li>
        <li>Pack cucumbers into jar so that they are snug against each other. The packing of the cucumbers is imperative to keeping pickles foodsafe. If packed well, cucumbers will not rise above the brine. </li>
        <li>Divide liquid evenly into packed jars.</li>
        <li>Cover the jar with a kitchen towel or loosely closed lid and band.</li>
        <li>Check pickle jar daily.<bold>You may notice some scum on the top of the jar. It's perfectly safe & natural, you can either scoop it off or leave it.</bold></li>
        <li>Taste the pickles after a few days. They may taste salty at first, but extended fermentation will allow the flavor to mellow.</li>
        <li>After degree of desired doneness (1-4 weeks) move pickles into the refrigerator where they will keep for six months.</li>
    </ol>
